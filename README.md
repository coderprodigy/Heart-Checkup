WHO announced that cardiovascular diseases is the top one killer over the world. There are seventeen million people died from it every year, especially heart disease. Prevention is better than cure. If we can evaluate the risk of every patient who probably has heart disease, that is, not only patients but also everyone can do something earlier to keep illness away.
Heart Checkup is a great dashboard where users can see the condition of their heart and know if its not well.

## üöÄ About Me
I'm an upcoming Software Engineer at JP Morgan and Chase. I love to code and explore various technical stacks. I am an aspiring Dataset.
Feel free to connect with me and I would love to work together on various projects üë®üèª‚Äçüíª.

[comment]: <> (## Why Cruiser?)

[comment]: <> (As Tokyo Olympic Games just drew to an end, I wanted to review 120 years history of Modern Olympic Game. Modern Olympic Games are leading international sport events. The creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to 4th century AD. The first modern Games was held in Athens in 1896.)

## Features

- Real Time Prediction
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform

## The Dataset
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

Attribute Information:

1. age

2. sex

3. chest pain type (4 values)

4. resting blood pressure

5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8. maximum heart rate achieved

9. exercise induced angina

10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

11. The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

[comment]: <> (## Data Exploration)

[comment]: <> (There are two csv files under this dataset. AthleteEvents contains the detail of the athlete participating in each event. It have the height, weight, age and name of athletes, the sport and the event and the result&#40;medal won&#41;. nocRegion contains the three letters NOC name and respective regions.)

[comment]: <> (## The Pipeline)

[comment]: <> (1. Extract and Clean the data from both CSV files.)

[comment]: <> (3. Create an overall medal tally with customisation for each year and each country.)

[comment]: <> (4. EDA is performed to visualise the participation of nations over time, find the most successful athletes of all time and much more.)

[comment]: <> (4. To understand the performance of countries over time and their best athletes various visualisations have been done.)

[comment]: <> (5. Use Streamlit to create a user interface that connects to the Python functions coded on the back-end. Those functions return data that is converted into charts and displayed on the application.)


## Libraries Used in the Project

### For Analysis and i/o operations
Logistic Regression is used.

Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labelled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.

### For Visualization
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

### For the Front End
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful apps for visualizing data. It provides a blazingly fast, iterative, and interactive development loop. It is a great way to build highly interactive web applications around their data, machine learning models, and pretty much everything.


## For Deployment
